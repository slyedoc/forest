# Forest Experiments

A playground of my bevy and rust experiments

> Basically I gluing together community plugins and taking them apart for fun.

## App Structure

* **Bundles**: An attempt at making things reuseable
* **Editor**: Toggleable Egui editor
* **Helper**: Useful generic functions and hacky tools
* **Linden Mayer**: [L-System](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) from for procedural geometry
* **Scenes**: The scenes to test things, oddly not using bevy scenes yet though.

## WARNING

A lot of this is really poorly implemented

## Current Thoughts

* Really want to try out ui4 or 5.
* I am sick at trying to get versions of everything working together. Updating most plugins have been trivial, even enjoy it.  Its fighting cargo to get them all to get them using the same , its getting better.
* Going to wait for new render-pipeline and naga before looking into wasm
* Need to start pulling in pull request, as get a workflow down and become more productive and can give back
