# Forest Experiments

A playground of my bevy and rust experiments

> Basically I gluing together community plugins and taking them apart for fun.

## App Structure

* **Bundles**: An attempt at making things reuseable
* **Editor**: Toggleable Egui editor
* **Helper**: Useful generic functions and hacky tools
* **Linden Mayer**: [L-System](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) from for procedural geometry
* **Scenes**: The scenes to test things, oddly not using bevy scenes yet though.

## WARNING

A lot of this is really poorly implemented

## Thoughts

Really want to try out ui4 or 5.

I am sick at trying to get versions of everything working together, I don't even mind updating them, its fighting them all to get them on the same version, its getting better.
> Plan to stop forking everything with better understanding of patching in cargo.
